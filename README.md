# Status-Posting-System
A Simple PHP Web Development Application - Grade: A+

The aim of this assignment is to create a diary system for a social networking site. This system will
allow users to post their status and save it to a database table. These posted status details can
also be retrieved using text matching and all matched status reports can be viewed in the order
they are posted. 
For this assignment, I used HTML, PHP, CSS and MySQL. 

## Home Page
This web page contains the form that enables a status to be submitted and saved

## Search Status Result Page
This web page checks the status search string, reads the data from the status database table,
searches for the occurrence of the status string in each status record and generates the
corresponding HTML output in response to the userâ€™s search request.
